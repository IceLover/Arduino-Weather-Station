Receive La Crosse TX4 weather sensor data with Arduino and send to
serial (USB) port.  Also calculates the dewpoint from current
temperature and relative humidity, and records indoor temperature from
a thermistor.  The Arduino does not output the time of measurements,
so a timestamp should be added when the data are logged by acomputer.
A sample logging script is included.

This project is based on the Weather Station Receiver from Practical Arduino,

 http://www.practicalarduino.com/projects/weather-station-receiver

and is based on some of their original code, found at:

 http://github.com/practicalarduino/WeatherStationReceiver

Further help in decoding data packets came from:

Dewpoint formula is from :

Lawrence, M., The relationship between relative humidity and the
   dewpoint temperature in moist air: A simple conversion and
   applications, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,
   86, 225â€“233, doi:10.1175/BAMS-86-2-225, 2005
